## LF2 Preservation Project
## In memory of the good ol' days

### What is this?

This page is dedicated to a small project I started in efforts to save and preserve as many LF2 mods as possible and making them available to LF2 enthusiasts worldwide.

### What is LF2?
![](https://lf2.net/lf2_pic/7.gif)

It is a freeware(as in price) made in Hong Kong, for the world. The game featured 10 distinct characters fighting their ways through different stages to defeat strong enemies. The game was such a big hit it became famous in the SEA region and later had fans from all over the world. For the millennials, LF2 was one of their fond memories of childhood, and that includes me.

### So what are you exactly doing?

LF2 was a popular game, and it had mods just like other games. However, since LF2 was a dated game, the mods were equally dated and can be hard to come by now. What I am doing is hoarding every last piece of LF2 mods still available for download, and keep them safe in my cloud storage spaces. I have 1 paid cloud storage and 1 free cloud storage from different providers. So I expect to host these files for as long as these providers live.

### What is the catch?

There is no catch. I do not charge for these files because I am not the author. However, if you are a LF2 fan and find these mods interesting, feel free to make translation and/or play with your friends!

### Why are most mods in Chinese?

I am sorry but I do not know where to start with foreign mods and I could only scrap for LF2 mods in Chinese. However, you are welcome to send me LF2 mods (that are not translation of mods I already saved).

### (Insert Antivirus Name) detected malware and viruses in your files!

I am sorry for that. Some versions have modified executable and could be hardened with UPX, that way tends to make them look malicious. Always do a scan with your antivirus before launching any executable files downloaded. Additionally, you can use Virus Total to scan for malicious behaviours.

If you are still worried, you can run the game first under protection of Sandboxie. Then run only without protection after no malicious behaviour is observed.

### How do I send you mods I have?

Please create an issue at this Github repo. Use the template LF2 Preservation Project Submission to get started. You need to fill in all the fields. If you do not wish to be listed in credits, please write Anonymous in the field Your nickname.

Please note that when you send me the mods:

    You do not send malware.
    You do not spam the issues
    Make sure the mods you are sending are not already in the archive (otherwise it will just get rejected)

I will report any form of misconduct IMMEDIATELY to Github Support should you abuse my repo.

### Installation and Usage

Most modifications contain only the modified files and require LF2 official version v1.9c to work properly. Some are based
on version v2.0a. Please refer to README files of each mods. Some mods already have LF2 files within.

In addition to uploading mod files, I repackaged some of them to make file sizes smaller. In order to decompress 7z files, you will need a dedicated
unarchive software like 7-zip

> If your mod requires original files to work:
Please copy and paste the mods file to LF2 official version folder and overwrite the content. Since LF2 is portable,
it is best using a copy of the LF2 folder, this way you can quickly copy multiple LF2 mods without installing the game again.

> To solve problems LF2 not loading:
Check if you installed VC++ 2005 redist SP1. I included the redist install files in the Redists folder.

### License and Persmissions

Since these modifications are dated, the original authors cannot be contacted with ease. I uploaded these files to
preserve the creative works these people made, and to cherish the joyous moments LF2 have brought us in the early days
of the Internet. Because I have not acquired the permission from (most) original authors, please do note that these files may
be taken down with written notice by the author.
